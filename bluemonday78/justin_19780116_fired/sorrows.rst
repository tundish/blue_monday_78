A pub in Shepherd's Bush
------------------------

.. Monday afternoon.
.. Justin has been working as a junior for Stiff Records.
.. He's just been fired.
.. Justin is carrying a Sony Pressman TC-D5.

[BARMAN]_

    So what paper are you with, then?

[HIPSTER]_

    What?

[BARMAN]_

    I'm guessing by the tape recorder and the early and expeditious application of
    my best whisky that you may be a journalist.

[HIPSTER]_

    No, I'm in music. Or I was until this afternoon.

[BARMAN]_

    Oh dear. Trouble?

[HIPSTER]_

    Well I made the mistake of booking a tour bus with Bulldog Coaches.

[BARMAN]_

    Bulldog Coaches? The white ones with the red stripes?

[HIPSTER]_

    Yes.

[BARMAN]_

    And a big snarling bulldog painted on the side.

[HIPSTER]_

    Yes.

[BARMAN]_

    Trailing a broken chain from a studded collar and wrapped in a Union Flag.

[HIPSTER]_

    That's the one.

[BARMAN]_

    That would be Victor Yeoman's outfit then.

[DRINKER_1]_

    I remember Victor way, way back. He used to do the Ramsgate run every weekend in the summer.

[DRINKER_2]_

    And all winter. Christmas Eve, too.

[DRINKER_1]_

    Do you remember? We used to go out to Ramsgate when we were kids.

[BARMAN]_

    Much business in Ramsgate over the Winter?

[DRINKER_2]_

    There was for Vic. He used to move stuff back and forth. All sorts of gear.
    Regular. All year round.

    I don't think he even wanted passengers, really. He does football tours too.
    So long as it's Holland or Spain.

[BARMAN]_

    Very much a patriot, is Vic. Of the old school variety. And some of his circle can be a bit...

[HIPSTER]_

    A bit right wing?

[BARMAN]_

    I'd say a bit right wing, yes.

[DRINKER_1]_

    Some of those Ramsgate trips could be rather...

    Tense.

    Too much for some people.

[HIPSTER]_

    Too much for Elvis Costello, certainly.

[DRINKER_2]_

    Who?
