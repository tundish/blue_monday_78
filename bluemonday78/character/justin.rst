Justin DelCroix
===============

Justin was born in Antigua to a large, wealthy family. His grandfather
had founded a shipping line, the operation of which was inherited by his
uncle, 'Champagne' Charlie DelCroix.

Justin's father George was the youngest brother, who became an insurance
broker. While successful, George was not the inspirational figure Justin
needed, and he grew up a frustrated young man, always removed from the action.

Justin was determined to work for his uncle. Was it simply inexperience, or
was it his eagerness to impress which prompted so many errors unbefitting
a scion of a globally trading firm?

Whatever the case, Charlie eventually decided he wanted Justin somewhere else,
and funded him to attend a business course at City University, London.

All might have turned out well were it not for a sudden crisis back home which
severely impacted Charlie's capacity for philanthropy. The exorbitant fees
charged to foreign students no longer affordable, Justin has to drop out of
his course and make a living wherever he can find it.

Justin's first real job is as a runner for Stiff Records at their place in
Bayswater. It takes about two weeks before he is fired.
