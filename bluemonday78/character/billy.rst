Billy McCarthy
==============

Homeless since the age of 16, Billy has been living in a succession
of squats, most recently in (?), Kensington.

He is in prison for assaulting a Police Officer during an eviction
operation to clear the building.

Some of his fellow squatters were middle class kids, who went home to
Mom and Dad. Billy was the only one to get a custodial sentence, and he
is bitter about what he feels is unfair treatment.

He has been sharing a cell with Martin Sheppey, and has been teaching
him to read. They have two books; Orwell's `Animal Farm` and
`On the Taboo against knowing who you are` by Alan Watts.
