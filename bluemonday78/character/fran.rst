Francesca Farington
===================

Born London, 1954, to Ray and Maria.

Raised as a working class girl, Francesca nevertheless
was well cared for by her mother, and even a little spoiled
by her father.

She rebelled a little in her teens, and struggled after leaving school.
She started hanging around the Soho folk scene, particularly at
John Martyn's gigs at Les Cousins in Greek Street.

As she gained her self-confidence she began to realise that
while a downwardly-mobile beatnik lifestyle held an attraction for many
in the middle classes, what she wanted for herself was advancement.

She is now working for a reputable Estate Agent in Paddington.
She is ambitious and attractive. She has learned to present herself
convincingly as an educated professional.

She has dated men from the professional classes, but doesn't really
understand or respect them.
