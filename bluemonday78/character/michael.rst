Michael Waladli
===============

Michael was born in Antigua. His Mother worked at a hotel in English Harbour,
and they lived nearby in staff accommodation. He never knew his father.

As a young boy Michael was drawn to music. He hung around the local fishermen
so he could listen to the songs playing on their battery-powered radios.
Music was a big part of the island's tourist experience. Every hotel had a band
of one sort or another.
 
By his early teens, Michael was singing in various establishments around the
island, mostly performing Calipso numbers for tourists. He also worked briefly
at the commercial docks in St John's but by then he had figured out that wasn't
where his future lay.

Whilst a teenager, Michael had been mixing mostly with adults. His musical gigs
introduced him to some interesting characters on the scene. He was able
to meet a few wealthy and educated people, both local and from abroad. He
achieved a level of confidence around those people which belied his own humble 
background and basic education.

He wasn't far into his twenties before it dawned that he didn't want his Mother
cleaning hotels into her old age. Vowing to give her a better life, and after
several tearful discussions and arguments with her, he took the painful
decision to leave the island for work in the UK.

He begins as a waiter in London, living in a hostel and sending back money
home by Postal Order every week.
