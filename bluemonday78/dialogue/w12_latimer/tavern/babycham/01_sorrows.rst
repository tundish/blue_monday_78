Sorrows
~~~~~~~

..  Stiff Records' first office was at 32 Alexander St, Bayswater.
    Quite walkable from Shepherd's Bush.

A pub in Shepherd's Bush
------------------------

[NARRATOR]_

    Monday afternoon.

    Just two hours ago, Stiff Records fired their most junior runner.

    He ran off with a Sony Pressman TC-D5 and is
    now in the Goldhawk Tavern, Shepherd's Bush.

[BARMAN]_

    So what paper are you with, then?

[HIPSTER]_

    What paper?

[BARMAN]_

    I'm looking at your tape recorder.

    And I'm noting the early and expeditious application
    of my best whisky.

    So I'm going to guess you may be a journalist.

Justin pipes up
---------------

[HIPSTER]_

    I'm in the music industry.

    Or I was until today.

    Got my marching orders this morning.

[BARMAN]_

    Oh dear. Did they pay you off though?

[HIPSTER]_

    Yes, I've got it right here.

[BARMAN]_

    Ah, good.
 
He's on the phone
-----------------

[HIPSTER]_

    They told me to go out and hire a tour bus.

    It was all very last minute.

[BARMAN]_

    Did you look in the Yellow Pages?

[HIPSTER]_

    No point.

    There's only one phone in the office and I could never get on it.

    So I went round to a place near here. It's on my way home.

What not to do
--------------

[HIPSTER]_

    Bulldog coaches, do you know them?

[BARMAN]_

    That would be Victor Yeoman's yard then.

    On Depot Road.

[HIPSTER]_

    That's the one.

There's your mistake
--------------------

[BARMAN]_

    Victor goes back and forth a lot to Holland and Spain.

    I don't think he really likes taking passengers though, to be honest.

[HIPSTER]_

    Do you find him slighty right wing?

[BARMAN]_

    I'd say a bit right wing, yes.

Not what I asked for
--------------------

[HIPSTER]_

    So the coach turned up covered in England flags and smelling of sick.

[BARMAN]_

    And that's why you got the sack.

[HIPSTER]_

    Not what Elvis Costello wanted at all.
