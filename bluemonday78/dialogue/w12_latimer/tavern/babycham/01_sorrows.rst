A pub in Shepherd's Bush
------------------------

[NARRATOR]_

    Monday afternoon.

    Just two hours ago, Stiff Records fired their most junior runner.

    He ran off with a Sony Pressman TC-D5 and is
    now in the Goldhawk Tavern, Shepherd's Bush.

[BARMAN]_

    So what paper are you with, then?

[HIPSTER]_

    What?

[BARMAN]_

    I'm guessing by the tape recorder and the early and expeditious application 
    of my best whisky that you may be a journalist.

Justin pipes up
---------------

[HIPSTER]_

    I'm in music. Or I was until this morning. Got my marching orders.

[BARMAN]_

    Oh dear. Trouble?

What not to do
--------------

[HIPSTER]_

    I made the mistake of booking a tour bus with Bulldog Coaches.

    You know, the white ones with the red stripes?

    And a big bulldog on the side.

[BARMAN]_

    Trailing a broken chain from a studded collar and wrapped in a Union Flag?

[HIPSTER]_

    That's the one.

There's your mistake
--------------------

[BARMAN]_

    That would be Victor Yeoman's company then.

    I don't think he really likes passengers to be honest.

    He just goes back and forth to Holland or Spain.

[HIPSTER]_

    Do you find him a bit right wing?

[BARMAN]_

    I'd say a bit right wing, yes.

Not alone though
----------------

[DRINKER_1]_

    Those Ramsgate trips could be rather tense.

[HIPSTER]_

    Not what Elvis Costello was after, certainly.

[DRINKER_2]_

    Who?
